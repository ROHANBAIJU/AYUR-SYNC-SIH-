This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Clinician Workspace (patient card redesign)

Navigate to `/clinician` to try the clinician tools with a patient-centric UI:

- Patient card: Enter optional Name, Age, and Patient ID.
- System & Codes: Choose Ayurveda/Siddha/Unani, enter a NAMASTE code, or provide an ICD Name.
- Actions:
	- Search: Runs public lookup across verified mappings.
	- Translate Code: NAMASTE â†’ ICD-11 and TM2; builds a FHIR Condition preview.
	- Translate by ICD Name: Enrich details by ICD name when diagnosis is known.
- FHIR Tools: Quick buttons for `/metadata`, `CodeSystem/{system}`, `$lookup`, `$expand`, `$translate`.
- FHIR Condition (preview): Copyable JSON assembled from translate results and patient info.

Tips:
- Use either NAMASTE code or ICD Name for translation.
- The Search field can filter `$expand` when populated.
- The page works with your JWT if signed in, or uses a dev token in development.
