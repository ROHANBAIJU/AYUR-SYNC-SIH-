    Securely accepts a FHIR Bundle containing clinical data.

    In a real-world scenario, this endpoint would:
    1.  Perform initial validation on the bundle's structure.
    2.  Add the bundle to a secure processing queue (like RabbitMQ or Kafka).
    3.  A separate worker would then pick up the bundle and securely forward it to a
        dedicated FHIR server (like HAPI FHIR) for permanent, versioned storage.
    4.  Log the entire transaction for auditing purposes, linking it to the authenticated user.

    For the hackathon demo, we will simulate this by accepting the data, printing a
    confirmation to the console, and returning a success message.
