"Siddha","KFB","Aẕal","6A70-Personality disorder with predominantly arrogant and self-centered behavior","60%","While 'Aẕal' (அழல்) translates to arrogance, it lacks the specific diagnostic criteria for other personality disorders; ICD-11's 6A70 best captures the essence of self-centered arrogance described, albeit with lower confidence due to the limited information."
"Siddha","KFB1.1","Aẕal Cerukku Nōy","EB00.1 - Unspecified gastroenteritis","80%","The symptoms described, including diarrhoea, fever, thirst, and dryness of tongue, point towards a gastrointestinal disorder.  The mention of derangement and increased Aẕal, while not directly translatable, doesn't contradict a general gastroenteritis diagnosis, given the prominent gastrointestinal symptoms."

"Siddha","ZAA1.5","Curacūlai","Viral influenza","80%","The symptoms of Curacūlai, including fever, body ache, and abdominal pain, strongly suggest a systemic viral infection like influenza, although the bleeding gums warrant further investigation and might point towards a more complex diagnosis; however, the core symptoms heavily favor influenza within the ICD-11 framework."
"Siddha","ZAA1.6","Pakkacūlai","Pain in chest, unspecified","80%","The description of 'Pakkacūlai' emphasizes intolerable pricking chest pain along with associated symptoms like fever, body ache, and dyspnea, aligning it broadly with unspecified chest pain, though more specific ICD-11 codes may require further clinical details."

"Siddha","ZAB1.3","Kaṟaicūlai","Pain in hand, unspecified","80%","The description of 'pricking pain, burning sensation, and sweating in the palm and sole' aligns with general pain symptoms, lacking specificity for a more precise ICD-11 code;  'increased Aẕal' and affected 'udal thathukkal' are not directly translatable to ICD-11 categories."

While 'depressive psychosis' is mentioned, the catatonic and other features are more prominent and characteristic of schizophrenia."
"Siddha","Z$4","Tamanta Pittam","5F00","80%","The description of 'Tamanta Pittam' points to a severe depressive episode with somatic symptoms (dry tongue, yellowish discoloration), consistent with ICD-11's 'Depressive episode' within the category of mood disorders, accounting for the Siddha system's humoral imbalance perspective."

However, the accompanying symptoms such as headache, weakness, and vomiting suggest additional comorbid conditions, possibly including a somatoform disorder, therefore M70-79 and F48 are both possible ICD-11 mappings depending on additional clinical information."

"Siddha","Z#","Aiya (Kapa) Nōykaḷ","Respiratory tract diseases","80%","'Aiya (Kapa)' in Siddha medicine refers to Kapha dosha, imbalances of which are associated with respiratory conditions;  'Nōykaḷ' signifies diseases, therefore,  'Diseases due listed under Aaiyam' points towards various respiratory tract illnesses encompassing those covered in the ICD-11 chapter on respiratory diseases."
